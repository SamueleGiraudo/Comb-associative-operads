\begin{abstract}
    The associative operad is the quotient of the magmatic operad by
    the operad congruence identifying the two binary trees of degree
    $2$. We introduce here a generalization of the associative operad
    depending on a nonnegative integer $d$, called $d$-comb associative
    operad, as the quotient of the magmatic operad by the operad
    congruence identifying the left and the right comb binary trees of
    degree $d$. We study the case $d = 3$ and provide an orientation
    of its space of relations by using rewrite systems on trees and
    the Buchberger algorithm for operads to obtain a convergent
    rewrite system.
