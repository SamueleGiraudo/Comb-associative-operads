\maketitle

Please find here the modifications made to the manuscript
``Quotients of the magmatic operad: lattice structures and convergent
rewrite systems'' submitted to Experimental Mathematics, following
the comments of the reviewer.
\bigbreak

\begin{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item `` {\it
The allusions in two places to "intervals in the Tamari order" are
rather strange. If you have any evidence or hint that this could be a
good condition, please tell the reader.
}''
\smallbreak

For the while, we have no general result connecting the quotients of
the magmatic operad and intervals of Tamari lattices but we suspect
that there is a link between the properties of the equated trees
with respect to the Tamari order and the description of the quotient
operad. This question was actually one of the starting points of this
work, and the research rather leads up to the presented results.
